#Lab Results

Based on the two waveforms presented, I would conclude that the behavioral and structural designs accomplished the same outcome because the waveforms were the same. I checked the waveforms against the one provided in the lab handout and they were the same. Also, I went through the truth table and checked the outputs myself so I think I can conclude the system design worked as desired. Based on what I could see in the decoder output and circuit diagram. I would think that a decoder would take an input from n bits and convert it to a 2^n signal.
